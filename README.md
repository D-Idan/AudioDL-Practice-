INTUITIVE AUDIO DEEP LEARNING SERIES
### Audio Deep Learning Made Simple

Although Computer Vision and NLP applications get most of the buzz, there are many groundbreaking use cases for deep learning with audio data that are transforming our daily lives. Over the next few articles, I aim to explore the fascinating world of audio deep learning.
Here’s a quick summary of the articles I am planning in the series. My goal throughout will be to understand not just how something works but why it works that way.

1 State-of-the-Art Techniques— this article (What is sound and how it is digitized. What problems is audio deep learning solving in our daily lives. What are Spectrograms and why they are all-important.)

2 Why Mel Spectrograms perform better (Processing audio data in Python. What are Mel Spectrograms and how to generate them)

3 Feature Optimization and Augmentation (Enhance Spectrograms features for optimal performance by hyper-parameter tuning and data augmentation)

4 Audio Classification (End-to-end example and architecture to classify ordinary sounds. Foundational application for a range of scenarios.)

5 Automatic Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text algorithm and architecture, using CTC Loss and Decoding for aligning sequences.)

6 Beam Search (Algorithm commonly used by Speech-to-Text and NLP applications to enhance predictions)
